### Thanks for contributing

##### Thanks goes to these wonderful people:

- [Pranav Purwar](https://github.com/PranavPurwar): for Android CI Workflow.
- [Ahmed Sbai](https://github.com/sbaiahmed1): for Supporting me since the beginning of Moon Meet.

Thanks, they help to keep **Moon Meet** alive. It's better to have multiple people work on a project, for more ideas, fewer bugs. (sadly sometimes more), and generally quicker development. Each (helpful) contribution that gets thankfully accepted.
